# Control

Stability of linear and non-linear systems, controllability, state space models, canonical forms, state space design of controllers, pole placement, LQR, observability, Luenberger observer, separation principle and certainty equivalence, loop transfer recovery, correspondence between system theoretic results for continuous- and discrete-time systems. Lab work involving applications of PID, lead-lag, full state feedback and LQR controllers to robotic devices.
